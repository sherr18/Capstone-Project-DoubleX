# Capstone-Project-DoubleX

## Introduction
We are both movie lovers, so for the capstone we wanted to focus on some of the issues about movie.

We are concerned that many people can not make a good choice when they want to watch a movie, so they may waste time or even lose interest. So we want to improve that as much as possible.

IFoundMovie is a movie recommendation website created by us. It aims to recommend movies to users that they may like.
